# Energy-Demand-Forecasting
Accurately predicting long-term electricity demand is crucial for making informed decisions regarding energy generation capacity and infrastructure. These forecasts play a vital role for energy policymakers, power utilities, private investors, and development professionals. Inaccurate predictions can have significant social and economic consequences. Underestimating demand can lead to power shortages and outages, negatively impacting productivity and economic growth. On the other hand, overestimating demand can result in excessive investments in generation capacity, potential financial difficulties, and higher electricity prices. Over the past few decades, various techniques have been developed to improve the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts. In this notebook, the objective is to build an energy demand forecasting system using Facebook Prophet, an open-source library introduced by Facebook's Core Data Science team. The dataset used for this task is the New York electricity demand dataset.
